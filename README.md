# Advent of Code 2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fun event that takes place every year in December. It consists of 25
daily challenges, each with two parts. The challenges are a mix of programming and puzzle solving.

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges, each package is a day with inputs to each challenge being
on `src/main/resources/dayXX/input.txt`.

Is my first time trying it out even though I suck but I'm having fun.

If I get stuck on a challenge, or I can't do part 2; I'll look up for a solution and post it under `solution` package on
that day to learn from it and to tackle the challenge any other day with at least some direction!
